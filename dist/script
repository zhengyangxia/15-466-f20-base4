0. It is the end of the 2019-20 football season. It is also the beginning of the busiest 
0. period for your job as a club director: the annual transfer window that lasts 8 weeks.
0. Your club, Manchester Red, managed to finish second in the past domestic league 
0. season. However, you are over 20 points behind the champion and your derby rival, 
0. Manchester Blue. Fans are calling for the club to improve the squad further and
0. become a real title challenger in the next season.
0. The board has given you a budget of 100 million euros in transfer fee. This is the
0. maximum NET spending you can make over the entire window. Selling existing
0. players may allow you to spend more than this amount in acquiring new players.
0. Your decisions will affect how the fans and the coach perceive you. Try to do a good
0. job and keep both of them happy!

0. The head coach of the team, Ole, has arranged a meeting with you this morning to
0. discuss his targets for this transfer window.
2. Good morning Mr. Director. Currently, the biggest weakness in our squad is the
2. position of Right Winger. If we can strengthen this position during this transfer
2. window, I promise we will be able to win the league next year.
2. My scouts and I have identified three players in this position as potential
2. targets. Here are their reports for your to review.
2. Just a reminder, I would like to know my squad and start preparing for the next
2. season as soon as possible, so it would be great if you can finish all the transfers
2. in the first month.

0. Jadon is our first-choice target. He is only 19 years old, but he is already one of
0. the best wingers in the world and has proven himself in multiple top competitions.
0. Jadon is also a fan favorite because he was born in Manchester. Because of this, he
0. is personally very willing to come back and play for a home club. 
0. Jadon's contract is set to expire next year, which means if his current club,
0. Ruhr Yellow, does not sell him this summer, they risk losing him for free next year.
0. The only downside of this deal is that he will be a very expensive transfer as
0. everyone knows Jadon is on his way to become a superstar.
0. We estimate that Jadon is worth at least 90 million euros.

0. Ousmane is our second-choice target. He used to be regarded as the most talented
0. right winger in the world, but he has suffered several severe injuries in recent
0. years. Over the past season he made only 14 apperances out of the total 50 games.
0. However, when Ousmane is fit to play, he can definitely bring huge improvements
0. to our team.
0. Ousmane is known to have disciplinary issues where he miss training sessions in
0. mornings because of staying up and playing video games. 
0. Fans are divided in their opinions regarding Ousmane for the reasons mentioned.
0. Ousmane is not eagerly looking for a move and is inclined to stay at Barca, but
0. we may be able to pursuade him otherwise.
0. We estimate that Ousmane is worth around 40 million euros.

0. Facundo is our third-choice target. He is only 18 years old and still a very
0. raw player, but he has shown the potential of a great player. 
0. Facundo will not bring immediate improvements to our team, but if he improves
0. as expected he will be a first-team player in 2-3 years.
0. This is in line with our club's philosophy of cultivating talented young players
0. on our own, so fans will most likely love this transfer.
0. Facundo wants to move to a top-tier club like us, but he is also interested in
0. and monitored by a lot of other clubs.
0. Facundo has a release-clause of 10 million euros, which means any can get him at
0. this price without negotiating with his current club.
0. We estimate that he is worth around 15 million euros.

2. In terms of incoming transfers, this is the only goal I have. I trust that
2. you will be able to get me at least one of these three players. Two is even better!
1. What about outgoing transfers? Any players you want to me to sell?
2. Well, as a coach I would always prefer to have more choices at my disposal.
2. But if you have to let someone go, I guess I will not be against selling Chris.
